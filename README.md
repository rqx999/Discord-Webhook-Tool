# Discord Webhook Tool

I made this because I saw way too many **skids** trying to rat and info-log people with sketchy webhook tools. This tool helps you manage, test, and mess with Discord webhooks **properly**â€”no shady nonsense.  

### ðŸš€ Features:  
âœ… **Validate** if a webhook is active or deleted  
âœ… **Modify** webhook name & avatar (avatar edit is broken, don't ask)  
âœ… **Send messages** via webhooks  
âœ… **Edit messages** already sent  
âœ… **Spam messages** (with delay to avoid rate limits)  
âœ… **Delete webhooks** to prevent abuse
